<h4> 
	NOTE: Since deploying it in cloud as a web all these conditions are to be taken care
	<br>
<ul>
	<li>Due to unavailability of `ruby gem` for reading all formats, Here you can only upload .xlsx (the latest format of excel in MS) so, please convert your file and import, else it will through error.  </li>
	<br>
<li>
As its a free hosting site ,Please Upload max of 250 records per import else the server will be timed out.
</li>
<br>
<li>DB can store only 10,000 records so please be aware of it</li>
<br>
<li>While uploading a sheet have check whether your sheet has `Item No` or `SKU` . Else it will through error.</li>
<br>
<li>Assumption: two sheets have `Item No` & one has `SKU` and hese 2 attributes have same length. so, Though they are different in real time , Here, for making relation between each sheet I am considering them as same attribute with different header. </li>
<br>
<li>The given sheet has same `Item No` for multiple records, so iam not making anything unique. </li>
<br>
<li>In the sample output provided, There is a interchange in column names. but my output won't have any interchange of column names. </li>
<br>
<li>Before Downloading the CSV/xls please feed the DB by uploading the input sheet. Initially the DB has no records.</li>
